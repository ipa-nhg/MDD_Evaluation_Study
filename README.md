## MDD EVALUATION STUDY

This repository collects data from the study we drive to evaluate the advantages of using Model-Driven Developemnt (MDD) techniques for the integration of robotics system based on ROS. For our case we used as MDD solution technology the RosTooling(*), which directly target the ROS ecosystem.

To cover all the aspects of an evaluation we opted for the combination of a quantitative with a qualitative evaluation. Both are documented within this repository:
- [Quantitative Study](Quantitative/README.md)
- [Qualitative Study](Qualitative/README.md)
